    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love Mexican food, but I think Mexican desserts are limited. Flan is great, but not every time. This
        Mexican-inspired avocado and lime cheesecake recipe is unique, easy, and fabulous. My friends constantly ask me
        to make it. You must have an ice cream maker.</p>

    <h2>Ingedients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ ripe avocados, peeled and pitted</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1 (8 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat cream in a small saucepan until small bubbles appear around the edges. Remove from the heat and stir in
            sugar until it dissolves. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl and allow to cool, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Blend avocado and cream cheese in a food processor until smooth. Add lime juice and process until smooth.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Whisk blended avocado mixture into cooled cream mixture, then pour into an ice cream maker. Freeze according
            to the manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Spoon avocado mixture into the prepared pie crust; smooth the surface with a spatula. Freeze until solid, at
            least 2 hours. Let cheesecake sit at room temperature until slightly softened yet firm enough to slice
            before serving, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
